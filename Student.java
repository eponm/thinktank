/* Student.java

    Each student includes:
        A last name
        Username
        4-digit SSN
        4-digit ID
        10 most recent ideas
        Average rating of 10 most recent ideas

    All of the above are simple data figures, except the 10 most recent ideas.
    The 10 most recent ideas will be a queue of pointers to the ideas stored in an Ideaheap.
    The average score is recomputed every time the queue changes.
